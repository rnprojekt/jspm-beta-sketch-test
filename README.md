Modern and efficient JavaScript frontend development is still a complex task.
This project aims to remedy some if the difficulties. The starter kit is a SystemJS +
JSPM based boilerplate with some little Gulp and Bash.

State-of-the-Art Javascript development should:

 * Be written in the newest syntax (currently ES6)
 * Support modular development out-of-the-box (SystemJS)
 * Not need complex tooling
 * Support 3rd party libraries with versioning out-of-the-box (JSPM)
 * Be framework and device agnostic
 * Support bundling and may be hot-reloading

The project is a work in progress and contains lot of dependencies which you
probably do not need for your own project. However it is easy to sor out what
you need.
